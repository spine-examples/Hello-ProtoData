# Introduction

Declarations in a `.proto` file can be annotated with 
a number of [options](https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/proto3/#options). 
Options do not change the overall meaning of a declaration, 
but may affect the way it is handled in a particular context.

Protobuf supports different types of options, e.g. file-level options, 
message-level options, field-level options, etc. The complete list of 
available options is defined in 
[/google/protobuf/descriptor.proto](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/main/src/google/protobuf/descriptor.proto).

Protobuf also allows to define and use [custom options](https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/proto2/#customoptions). 
The authors say "that this is an advanced feature which most people donâ€™t need" 
and it actually requires a significant amount of work to define a custom option 
and generate the validation code for this option. However, ProtoData provides 
a fairly easy way to collect the custom options metadata and extend the 
generated code with the desired behaviour.

# Domain

This use-case of applying ProtoData demonstrates how to enrich the model 
with additional semantic elements and reflect its meaning in the generated code.

For example, let's define a board for TicTacToe game:

```protobuf
// A board for TicTacToe game.
message Board {
  // The name of the board.
  BoardName name = 1;

  // The size of the board.
  int32 side_size = 2;
  
  // Board cells. It is expected to have "side_size * side_size" cells. 
  repeated Cell cell = 3;
}

message BoardName {
  string value = 1;
}

enum Mark {
  M_UNDEFINED = 0;
  CROSS = 1;
  CIRCLE = 2;
}

message Cell {
  oneof value {
    bool empty = 1;
    Mark mark = 2;
  }
}
```
Definitely, we can use this model but it is so easy to make some mistake when 
the model becomes invalid state. What can we do to avoid this?

It would be much better if we could add the following:

1. Mark some fields as `required` to admit that this is important
to initialize these fields.
2. Set the minimum acceptable value for the `side_size` field.
3. Add some validation rules that verify the size of the `cell` collection.

We can easily solve the points 1 and 2 as ProtoData provides options 
to mark the fields as `required` and validate values of the numeric fields.

Let's add these elements to the `Board` definition:

```protobuf
// A board for TicTacToe game.
message Board {
  // The name of the board.
  BoardName name = 1 [(required) = true];

  // The size of the board.
  int32 side_size = 2 [(required) = true, (min).value = "3"];

  // Board cells. It is expected to have "side_size * side_size" cells.
  repeated Cell cell = 3 [(required) = true];
}
...
```

Also, we can define a custom option to check the size of the `cell` field
and use ProtoData API to generate the required validation code.

Below is definition of the `size` custom option:
```protobuf
extend google.protobuf.FieldOptions {

    // See `ArrayOfSizeOption` for details.
    //
    // The field index is chosen based in `spine/options.proto`,
    // taking the next available number in Spine's reserved range.
    //
    ArrayOfSizeOption size = 73855;
}

// A field option applicable to `repeated` fields,
// telling that their size should be equal
// to some expression, involving the values
// of other fields of the same message.
//
// The `value` field supports basic math operations,
// such as `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.
//
message ArrayOfSizeOption {

    string value = 1 [(required) = true];
}
```

Now let's use this option in the `Board` definition:

```protobuf
// A board for TicTacToe game.
message Board {
  // The name of the board.
  BoardName name = 1 [(required) = true];

  // The size of the board.
  //
  // The board must have `side_size` number of cell rows,
  // each having `side_size` number of columns,
  // effectively making the board "square".
  //
  int32 side_size = 2 [(required) = true, (min).value = "3"];

  // Board cells. It is expected to have "side_size * side_size" cells.
  repeated Cell cell = 3 [(required) = true, (size).value = "side_size * side_size"];
}
...
```

The [ApplySizeOptionPlugin](codegen-plugin/src/main/kotlin/io/spine/examples/protodata/hello/plugin/ApplySizeOptionPlugin.kt) 
is implemented to generate the validation code for the `size` option. 
It uses ProtoData API to customize the code generation for Protobuf messages.

The plugin generates extensions for the message builder classes
with validation methods for every field with `size` option applied.
Below is the generated validation method for the `cell` field.

```kotlin
internal fun Board.Builder.validateCellCount(): Board.Builder {
    val expected = sideSize * sideSize
    check(cellCount == expected) {
        "Invalid number of 'cell' elements: " +
            "expected $expected, but actual $cellCount."
    }
    return this
}
```

Also, the `build()` method of a message builder class is updated
to call these methods.

See the [codegen-plugin](codegen-plugin) subproject for details.

The following configuration should be applied in the Gradle configuration 
of a module to use the `size` option plugin:
```kotlin
protoData {
    // Run ProtoData with the `size` option plugin enabled.
    plugins(
        "io.spine.protodata.hello.ApplySizeOptionPlugin"
    )
}
```
